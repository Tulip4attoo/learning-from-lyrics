,Mallary Hope, Blossom In The Dust,"There's a single-wide trailer past the railroad tracks,Old car in the front, weeds in the back,Mama had there when she was sixteen years old,Took one look at her and named her Rose,Fragile little Rose had to grow up fast,Between the habit and the job that her mama had,I've never seen a situation half that bad,She's a blossom in the dust,All her colors covered up,Give a rose a little rain,Lots of sun and all your love,And watch her blossom in the dust,We rescued that child in the nick of time,Found a real nice couple 'cross the county line,Who'd been trying to have a little girl of their own,And would give anything to give little Rose a home,That mama-to-be took one look at her,In her tattered flowered dress and her tangled curls,She said that's not just any girl,She's a blossom in the dust,All her colors covered up,Give a rose a little rain,Lots of sun and all your love,And watch her blossom in the dust,Oh, sometimes the only way to overcome a circumstance,Is someone giving someone else a fighting chance,She's a blossom in the dust,All her colors covered up,Give a rose a little rain,Lots of sun and all your love,And watch her blossom in the dust

,Mark Chesnutt, Long Way To Go,"Well, I met old Wailin back in '79,When I was in my teens,When I told him what was on my mind,He said son you don't wanna feel like me,There's a lot 'bout my life that you don't know,And boy it sure ain't good,The big wheels will drive you crazy,And the highway will make you do things you never would,When you're living in the spotlight,It's another world every night,It's a different town everyday,You pay your dues if you're gonna play,The only thing that makes it worthwhile,Is a big crowd going wild,But you gotta long way to go,You gotta long, long way to go,But I've had this in my blood since the day,I held a guitar in my hand,And it wasn't long till Baumann was the home,Of another cowboy band,And too cold at home put me on the road,And I know exactly how he felt,Back then how was I to know,That the hands of fate for me were already dealt,Now I'm living in the spotlight,It's another town every night,It's a different world everyday,You pay your dues if you're gonna play,The only thing that makes it worthwhile,Is a big crowd going wild,But I've gotta long way to go,I gotta long, long way to go,A long, long way to go

,Mark Erelli, Here & Now,"Cobblestone pillow,Newspaper sheets,Ten below zero,Sleeping on the street,Someday we all will have a home,A place to come in from the cold,Somewhere so high above the clouds,Why not here,Why not now,Pastures of plenty,For the tired and poor,Still too many hands empty,Behind the golden door,(Chorus),Someday we all will live the dream,There'll be no cracks to fall between,Somewhere where everyone will have enough,But here and now,It's up to us,Someday we all will be at peace,And all of our suffering will cease,There's more than enough to go around,Why not here,Why not now

,Mark Chesnutt, (Come On In) The Whiskey's Fine,"Me and my cousin Lendyl,Got lost hunting Coon,In the Carolina Mountains,Somewhere outside of Boone,We were just about to panic,When 'ol Lendyl saw the sign,It said, ""Come on in! The whiskey's fine."",That old shack looked abandoned,Roof all fallin' in,Just some pertrified planks,And some rusty ol' tin,We both likely crapped our britches,When a voice from inside,Yelled, ""Come on in! The whiskey's fine."",Then those swinngin' doors opened,He staggered out on the porch,Dressed just like Davey Crocket,Beard clear down to the floor,He said, ""The band's drunk, beer's skunked,,And we ain't got no wine,,But come on in! The whiskey's fine."",We peeked in over his shoulder,And the first thing that we saw,Was a boy pickin' a banjo,In a pair of overalls,He said, ""That boy is half crazy,,Plays the same song all the time,,But Hey come on in! The whiskey's fine."",""The food will make you sick,,The air will make you choke,,The waitress ain't a-workin',,And the Jukebox is broke."",He said, ""the band's drunk, beer's skunked,,And we ain't got no wine,,But come on in! The whiskey's fine."",He said, ""The pinballs won't roll,,The pool-table rocks,,And it hotter than two rats in heat,,Inside an old wool sock."",""I wouldn't drink the water,,It tastes like turpentine,,We're WAY overpriced,,And a little hard to find."",""The band's drunk, the beer's skunked,,And we ain't got no wine,,But come on in! The whiskey's fine."",""Ya'll come on it! The whiskley's fine!"",""Ya'll come on in!,Aawwww, The whiskley's fine!""
