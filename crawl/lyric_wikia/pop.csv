,Belinda Carlisle, Jezebel,"Jezebel... Jezebel...,Ce démon qui brûlait mon cœur,Cet ange qui séchait mes pleurs,C'était toi, Jezebel, c'était toi.,Ces larmes transpercées de joie,,Jezebel, c'était toi... Jezebel, c'était toi...,Mais l'amour s'est anéanti.,Tout s'est écroulé sur ma vie,,Écrasant, piétinant, emportant mon cœur,,Jezebel... Mais pour toi,,Je ferais le tour de la terre,,J'irais jusqu'au fond des enfers.,Où es-tu ? Jezebel, où es-tu ?,Les souvenirs que l'on croit fanés,Sont des êtres vivants,Avec des yeux de morts vibrants encore de passé,Mais mon cœur est crevé d'obsession.,Il bat en répétant,Tout au fond de moi-même,Ce mot que j'aime,,Ton nom...,Jezebel... Jezebel...,Mais l'amour s'est anéanti.,Tout s'est écroulé sur ma vie,,Écrasant, piétinant, emportant mon cœur,Jezebel... Mais pour toi,,Je ferais le tour de la terre,,J'irais jusqu'au fond des enfers,En criant sans répit,,Jour et nuit,,Jezebel... Jezebel...,JEZEBEL...

,"Belinda Carlisle,Edith Piaf,La Vie En Rose", La Vie En Rose,"Des yeux qui font baiser les miens,,Un rire qui se perd sur sa bouche,,Voila le portrait sans retouche,De l'homme auquel j'appartiens,Quand il me prend dans ses bras,Il me parle tout bas,,Je vois la vie en rose.,Il me dit des mots d'amour,,Des mots de tous les jours,,Et ca me fait quelque chose.,Il est entre dans mon coeur,Une part de bonheur,Dont je connais la cause.,C'est lui pour moi. Moi pour lui,Dans la vie,,Il me l'a dit, l'a jure pour la vie.,Et des que je l'apercois,Alors je sens en moi,Mon coeur qui bat,Des nuits d'amour a ne plus en finir,Un grand bonheur qui prend sa place,Des enuis des chagrins, des phases,Heureux, heureux a en mourir.,Quand il me prend dans ses bras,Il me parle tout bas,,Je vois la vie en rose.,Il me dit des mots d'amour,,Des mots de tous les jours,,Et ca me fait quelque chose.,Il est entre dans mon coeur,Une part de bonheur,Dont je connais la cause.,C'est toi pour moi. Moi pour toi,Dans la vie,,Il me l'a dit, l'a jure pour la vie.,Et des que je l'apercois,Alors je sens en moi,Mon coeur qui bat

,Maria Mena, Growing Pains,"No one will tell you about the limit,They put on how long you can grieve,No one will warn you when you're winning,How heavy a lost love can be,They do not tell you about the friendships,You'll lose once the lights are dimmed down,How humble you'll feel about your past bliss,Once the tables have turned 'round,But I wanna tell you I got through,The hardest of times on my own,I made some mistakes I made a few,But I learned that I am strong,And just because it hurts,Doesn't mean it isn't worth is,And even if it stings,It's just a temporary thing,I'm not saying that changing,Won't cost you love won't make you cry,,But it will all make sense…,When the growing pains subside,Nothing can shield you from the silence,Nights spent on his side of the bed,Praying for help to please stop crying,My life just got turned on its head,They fail to explain how complex love is…,Like why I mostly miss him as a friend,Or how big of a blow, it was for my ego,That she might be better for him…,But I wanna tell you I got through,The hardest of times on my own,I made some mistakes I made a few,But I learned that I am strong,And just because it hurts,Doesn't mean it isn't worth is,And even if it stings,It's just a temporary thing,And no one said that changing,Won't cost you love won't make you cry,,But it will all make sense…,When the growing pains subside,And just because it hurts,Doesn't mean it isn't worth is,And even if it stings,It's just a temporary thing,And no one said that changing,Won't cost you love won't make you cry,,But it will all make sense…,When the growing pains subside

,Maria Mena, You Deserve Better,"At the end of the day,I'm not proud of the way,I just shut off myself,And left you to yourself,As I look back on, when we first met,I feel guilty, I have regrets,I wasn't kinder to your heart,We never got our clean start,And you deserve better,No song nor a letter,Can't make right all my wrongs,Or rewrite what I've done,I'll save me and you'll save yourself,And we'll be better off with someone else,Save yourself and I'll save me,If you'll save yourself, I'll save me,For us I, I fought myself,Said I was sorry and, and sought help,For every two steps, I took in life,There was always one back, one strike,If I was too much of a task,Why'd you say that you would last,You might've been there physically,But you checked out early,And I deserve better,No poem nor a letter,Can't make right all your wrongs,Or rewrite what you've done,I'll save me and you'll save yourself,And we'll be better off with someone else,Save yourself and I'll save me,If you'll save yourself, I'll save me,And we deserve better,No song nor a letter,Can't make right all our wrongs,Or rewrite what we've done,I'll save me and you'll save yourself,And we'll be better off with someone else,Save yourself and I'll save me,If you'll save yourself, I'll save me

,Elvis Costello, Down Among The Wines And Spirits,"Down among the wines and spirits,Where a man gets what he merits,Once he was written in letters of nine feet tall,Now he finds how far he's fallen,Since he set his mind on her completely,Oh well, I guess that you mustn't have seen him lately,Walking around with a pain that never ceases,He starts to speak and then he falls to pieces,Down among the wines and spirits,Where a man gets what he merits,Lives with the echoing words of their final quarrel,The vacant chamber and the empty barrel,But as he picks himself up from a sawdust floor,Clicks his fingers to that swinging door,Suddenly he's calling out more, more, more,I'm twice the foolish man I was before,Down among the wines and spirits,Bubbles escaping from him from the rim of a glass of grape,She sails through his memory just like a ship of chaplet,As it started to sink, he was drinking to drown his sorrows,That fill his nights and they empty his tomorrows,But as he picks himself up from a sawdust floor,Clicks his fingers to that swinging door,Suddenly he's calling out more, more, more,Speaks of invisible things he hardly credits,Down among, down among,Down among the wines and spirits

,Paul Williams, If We Could Still Be Friends,"Love and I were strangers,Till you and I were friends,Into the shadows of my life,You brought sympathy and sunshine,I wish that we could still be friends,Once I held you now you've gone,And now each day must end with another night alone,Is there no one I can turn to,I wish that we could still be friends,Nobody moves me like you do,Your magic just goes on and on,We used to wake up every morning,Safe and warm,We'd laugh away the chill,I'd laugh again,If we could still be friends,Life is not a love song,But broken hearts will mend,And in the quiet of my room,We might sit and hold the pieces,I think that we could still be friends,Nobody moves me like you do,Your magic lust goes on and on,We used to wake up every morning,Safe and warm,We'd laugh away the chill,I'd laugh again,If we could still be friends,Love can put things back again,I wish that we could still be friends

Well, you cry and try to muscle through. Try to,rearrange your stuff. But when the wounds are deep enough, and it's all that we,can bear, we wrap ourselves. In prayer.,Because you cannot walk with the holy if you're just a halfway decent man, I,don't pretend that I'm a mastermind with a genius marketing plan. I'm trying to,tap into some wisdom. Even a little drop will do. I want to rid my heart of envy,,and cleanse my soul of rage before I'm through. A mother murmurs in twilight,sleep and draws her babies closer. With hush-a-byes for sleepy eyes, and kisses,on the shoulder. To drive away despair she says a wartime prayer.

We have to believe,We'll be free again if  we learn how to love and forgive ,There's a man on a sleigh and he is on his  way,,And the children  are singing,There's a man on the moon and he'll come  to you soon,,And the bells  will be ringing

Where did you hide?,Will I see you again?,Why don't you stay?"",And as I stood there alone,Staring into the night,I have seen a thousand people searching for the light,If you are lost and lonely,If you're alone today,Find that boy,And let him show you (the way),And he will care about you when the night is long,He will make you smile again and sing along,Let's join our hands and let us pray,For love on christmas day
