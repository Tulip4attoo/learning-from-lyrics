,Wildbirds & Peacedrums, The Drop,"To make a lover understand the meaning of an end,Letting go of the moment,The strong belief that your heart will mend,Trying to avoid the disappointment,Of suddenly being left all alone,Like waking up in a foreign country,Your language cannot stand by its own,And you're realising Oh God I'm lonely,In the morning light you feel at ease,Like you control your view and your emotion,The softest skin to touch them on the least,Like you could keep her close for now or never,Like the beating of the drum that never stops,The sound of wings made out of paper,Balancing a cloud on a mountain top,Like your hearts been reshaped just for her,Oh is she a passion is too fragile to see,But so strong to feel,To fall right into,And a passion becomes a lifetime disease,When all your fear is shining right through,Like the rolling of the thunder in the sky,When your belief is sinking lower,And the stillness when the moon is high,Is a moment when your hope is over.

,"Tom Rush,Emmylou Harris", Too Many Memories,"I remember this town with a girl by my side,And a love seldom felt in this day and time,And it gets melancholy every now and again,When you let your mind go and it drifts way back when,Life plays it's tricks, some cruel but fair,And even a fool can pretend they don't care,When there's too many memories for one heart to hold,Once a future so bright now seems so distant and cold,And the shadows grow long and your eyes look so old,When there's too many memories for one heart to hold,There are those moments and they just never fade,The look in his eyes and the way the light played,God moved in that moment and the angels all cried,And they gave you a memory that you have till you die,And the lessons you learn and you don't forget,What makes you grow old is replacing hope with regret,When there's too many memories for one heart to hold,Once a future so bright now seems so distant and cold,And the shadows grow long and your eyes look so old,When there's too many memories for one heart to hold,When there's too many memories for one heart to hold,Once a future so bright now seems so distant and cold,And the shadows grow long and your eyes look so old,When there's too many memories for one heart to hold

,Jack White, Blunderbuss,"I had my dream, I held your hand on that broad avenue,We crossed the road and never spoke to another as we flew,We left your man alone in drag laughing there at us,A romantic bust, a blunder turned, explosive blunderbuss,An ancient grand hotel of Persian thread and ivory,And when your man would turn his head I'd see you look at me,Pools of brown and sea of red and demons in your pocket,That same romance performed a dance inside a silver locket,Da da da da,Da da da da,A corner exit not tall enough to walk out standing straight,Designed by men so ladies would have to lean back in their gait,You grabbed my arm and left with me but you were not allowed to,You took me to a public place to quietly blend into,Such a trick pretending not to be doing what you want to do,But seems like everybody does this every waking moment,I laid you down and touched you like the two of us both needed,Safe to say that others might not approve of this and pleaded,""So selfish them"" would be their cry and who would be brave to argue?,Doing what two people need is never on the menu,Da da da da,Da da da da

To raise up.,Up on its feet again.,Did you feel this way too when I met you?,Did you look at me,And think,Here's me a guy,That hopes like I hope,And sees the same kind of new,Dreams I see?,Because you wondered, I know,If your hopes could find shape in,The words that we used there,To work back the fog -,Your hopes and your plans for the,Good of the people,Could all of your hundred and one,Dreams just as bright as the sun,And all of your wants and your hottest,Desires,Find shape in the flow of my talk?,And there by ourselves while the bronze,Statues watched us,We talked some. Kept still for,A time. Talked a little more.,Your hair had the smell of cleaness,About it and the wind helped my fingers to,Play with your curls -,And the wind and the mist caused the,Night to blow colder and we brought our hopes,There a little bit closer -,Hopes that we hoped,Work that we wanted,Jobs we were doing, aimed to do.,Quiet idle words, of the church and,The steeple. The union. The war.,And the world full of people.,And you gave my mind such a,Deep kind of light,It blasted the fog.,It blew up the night.,It pulled back the curtains of,Clouds from above us,And all of the stars came out and,Winked at us,And I yelled up at the stars,And said,You stars! Go ahead! Shine as,Bright as you want to!,Light up this round world and shine,If you want to!,And it was brighter than usual,And for some reason or other,The night,Turned off clear. And so cold.,It caused me to snuggle up closer,And hold,Hold on,Hold on to the ground we had gained.,Hold on to the new inch of life we discovered.,Hold on to the night.,We exchanged our dreams as we sat,There a while,Word by word.,Plan by plan.,Mile by mile.,You looked a bit hungry and skinny to,Me but,I had me the notion you'd soon fatten up.,You know how love is and you know,How dreams are. If you don't stay in love you,Soon wilt away and you get sort of hungry,Looking they say. So I thought you'd fill out,And look a lot better with a little work and,The right kind of weather.,You knew I was raily and some out of,Shape. And you knew that my eyes and my,Feet didn't mate. I was hunched and walked,Crooked - but you overlooked this because,With the right kind of home life and care,My old carcass and brain could be good,For more wear.,Your grace of walk and action drove,Me into fits. I tried to, but couldn't,Think about anything else. This world,Is an awful big machine and it moves,All together. No force on earth can,Hold it back - and I am in all of this,And moving with it - and I feel the,Motion and the rhythm of the universe,Moving with these planets.,And moving the earth along with them.,And the earth moving the people,Along,With it,And the attraction of your face and,Your form,Pulled me. Pushed me. Drew me.,It was ten thousand times stronger than,All of the rest of these,Powers multiplied by ten.,And I felt harmony and sweetness,And felt strife,And wanted to walk with you as my wife,Down to the foamy docks to ride a,Good boat,Across the troubled waters of this,Life.,You know the night I met you.,You know the night I met you,My eyes had been,Looking for you all over everywhere.,Over low roads. Down highways. Bald deserts.,I just felt like you feel when,You feel like the angels are curling your,Hair and you feel like the devil is,Scratching your heel.

,Bob Dylan, Tempest,"The pale moon rose in its glory,Out on the Western town,She told a sad, sad story,Of the great ship that went down,T'was the fourteenth day of April,Over the waves she rode,Sailing into tomorrow,To a golden age foretold,The night was black with starlight,The seas were sharp and clear,Moving through the shadows,The promised hour was near,Lights were holding steady,Gliding over the foam,All the lords and ladies,Heading for their eternal home,The chandeliers were swaying,From the balustrades above,The orchestra was playing,Songs of faded love,The watchman, he lay dreaming,As the ballroom dancers twirled,He dreamed the Titanic was sinking,Into the underworld,Leo took his sketchbook,He was often so inclined,He closed his eyes and painted,The scenery in his mind,Cupid struck his bosom,And broke it with a snap,The closest woman to him,He fell into her lap,He heard a loud commotion,Something sounded wrong,His inner spirit was saying,That he couldn't stand here long,He staggered to the quarterdeck,No time now to sleep,Water on the quarterdeck,Already three foot deep,Smokestack was leaning sideways,Heavy feet began to pound,He walked into the whirlwind,The sky splitting all around,The ship was going under,The universe had opened wide,The roll was called up yonder,The angels turned aside,Lights down in the hallway,Flickering dim and dull,Dead bodies already floating,In the double bottom hull,The engines then exploded,Propellers they failed to start,The boilers overloaded,The ship's bow split apart,Passengers were flying,Backward, forward, far and fast,They mumbled, fumbled, and tumbled,Each one more weary than the last,The veil was torn asunder,'Tween the hours of twelve and one,No change, no sudden wonder,Could undo what had been done,The watchman lay there dreaming,At fourtyfive degrees,He dreamed that the Titanic was sinking,Dropping to her knees,Wellington he was sleeping,His bed began to slide,His valiant heart was beating,He pushed the tables aside,Glass of shattered crystal,Lay scattered roundabout,He strapped on both his pistols,How long could he hold out?,His men and his companions,Were nowhere to be seen,In silence there he waited for,Time and space to intervene,The passageway was narrow,There was blackness in the air,He saw every kind of sorrow,Heard voices everywhere,Alarm-bells were ringing,To hold back the swelling tide,Friends and lovers clinging,To each other side by side,Mothers and their daughters,Descending down the stairs,Jumped into the icy waters,Love and pity sent their prayers,The rich man, Mister Astor,Kissed his darling wife,He had no way of knowing,It'd be the last trip of his life,Calvin, Blake and Wilson,Gambled in the dark,Not one of them would ever live to,Tell the tale on the disembark,Brother rose up 'gainst brother,In every circumstance,They fought and slaughtered each other,In a deadly dance,They lowered down the lifeboats,From the sinking wreck,There were traitors, there were turncoats,Broken backs and broken necks,The bishop left his cabin,To help others in need,Turned his eyes up to the heavens,Said, ""The poor are yours to feed"",Davey the brothel-keeper,Came out dismissed his girls,Saw the water getting deeper,Saw the changing of his world,Jim Dandy smiled,He never learned to swim,Saw the little crippled child,And he gave his seat to him,He saw the starlight shining,Streaming from the East,Death was on the rampage,But his heart was now at peace,They battened down the hatches,But the hatches wouldn't hold,They drowned upon the staircase,Of brass and polished gold,Leo said to Cleo,I think I'm going mad,But he'd lost his mind already,Whatever mind he had,He tried to block the doorway,To save all those from harm,Blood from an open wound,Pouring down his arm,Petals fell from flowers,'Til all of them were gone,In the long and dreadful hours,The wizard's curse played on,The host was pouring brandy,He was going down slow,He stayed right to the end and he,Was the last to go,There were many, many others,Nameless here forever more,They never sailed the ocean,Or left their homes before,The watchman, he lay dreaming,The damage had been done,He dreamed the Titanic was sinking,And he tried to tell someone,The captain, barely breathing,Kneeling at the wheel,Above him and beneath him,Fifty thousand tons of steel,He looked over at his compass,And he gazed into its face,Needle pointing downward,He knew he lost the race,In the dark illumination,He remembered bygone years,He read the Book of Revelation,And he filled his cup with tears,When the Reaper's task had ended,Sixteen hundred had gone to rest,The good, the bad, the rich, the poor,The loveliest and the best,They waited at the landing,And they tried to understand,But there is no understanding,On the judgement of God's hand,The news came over the wires,And struck with deadly force,Love had lost its fires,All things had run their course,The watchman he lay dreaming,Of all the things that can be,He dreamed the Titanic was sinking,Into the deep blue sea

There's a man close by"" (Henry Lee),""Don't worry about him, he wouldn't harm a fly."" (The Wife),From behind the curtain, the Boss he crossed the floor,He moved his feet and he bolted the door,Shadows hiding the lines in his face,With all the nobility of an ancient race,She turned, she was startled with a look of surprise,With a hatred that could hit the skies,""You're a reckless fool, I could see it in your eyes.,To come this way was by no means wise."",""Get up, stand up, you greedy-lipped wench,And cover your face or suffer the consequence.,You are making my heart feel sick.,Put your clothes back on, double-quick."",""Silly boy, you think me a saint.,I'll listen no more to your words of complaint.,You've given me nothing but the sweetest lies.,Now hold your tongue and feed your eyes."",""I'd have given you the stars and the planets, too.,But what good would these things do you?,Bow the heart if not the knee,Or never again this world you'll see"",""Oh, please let not your heart be cold.,This man is dearer to me than gold."",""Oh, my dear, you must be blind.,He's a gutless ape with a worthless mind."",""You've had your way too long with me.,Now it's me who'll determine how things shall be."",""Try to escape,"" he cussed and cursed.,""You'll have to try to get past me first."",""Do not let your passion rule.,You think my heart the heart of a fool.,And you, sir, you can not deny,You made a monkey of me, what and for why?"",""I'll have no more of this insulting chat.,The devil can have you, I'll see to that.,Look sharp or step aside,Or in the cradle you'll wish you'd died."",The gun went boom and the shot rang clear,First bullet grazed his ear,Second ball went right straight in,And he bent in the middle like a twisted pin,He crawled to the corner and he lowered his head,He gripped the chair and he grabbed the bed,It would take more than needle and thread,Bleeding from the mouth, he's as good as dead,""You shot my husband down, you fiend."",""Husband? What husband? What the hell do you mean?,He was a man of strife, a man of sin.,I cut him down and threw him to the wind."",This she said with angry breath,""You too shall meet the Lord of Death.,It was I who brought your soul to life."",Then she raised her robe and she drew out a knife,His face was hard and caked with sweat,His arms ached and his hands were wet,""You're a murderous queen and a bloody wife.,If you don't mind, I'll have the knife."",""We're two of a kind and our blood runs hot,But we're no way similar in body or thought.,All husbands are good men, as all wives know."",Then she pierced him to the heart and his blood did flow,His knees went limp and he reached for the door,His tomb was sealed, he slid to the floor,He whispered in her ear: ""This is all your fault.,My fighting days have come to a halt."",She touched his lips and kissed his cheek,He tried to speak but his breath was weak,""You died for me, now I'll die for you."",She put the blade to her heart and she ran it through,All three lovers together in a heap,Thrown into the grave, forever to sleep,Funeral torches blazed away,Through the towns and the villages all night and all day

No,But you have heard of them,I see you there,I'm blinded by the colors I see,I take good care,Of what belongs to me,I hear your name,Ringing up and down the line,I'm saying it plain,These ties are strong enough to bind,Now your sweet voice,Calls out from some old familiar shrine,I got no choice,Can't believe these things would ever fade from your mind,I could live forever,With you perfectly,You don't ever,Have to make a fuss over me,From East to West,Ever since the world began,I only mean it for the best,I want to be with you any way I can,I been in a brawl,Now I'm feeling the wall,I'm going away baby,I won't be back till fall,High on the hill,You can carry all my thoughts with you,You've numbed my will,This love could tear me in two,I wanna be with you in paradise,And it seems so unfair,I can't go to paradise no more,I killed a man back there,You think I'm over the hill,You think I'm past my prime,Let me see what you got,We can have a whoppin' good time

,Sandra Mihanovich, La Mirada,"Hay que mirar, aprender a considerar ,Y también saber aguzar, la mirada fina ,Brota el rosal, desparrama luz y color ,Pero algunos miran la flor, y otros las espinas. ,Todo depende de la mirada ,Lo poco parece mucho      ,Y a veces lo mucho es nada ,No hay que endiosar, al dinero no hay que endiosar ,Si al amor no puede comprar ni a una dulce siesta. ,La soledad del que tiene es más soledad ,Porque vale más de verdad, lo que nada cuesta. ,Todo depende etc etc, ,La copa está, solo apenas por la mitad ,Pero tu, que felicidad... No la vez vacía, ,Vuelve a mirar, imagina y vuelve a pensar ,Que te puedes emborrachar, pero de alegría.
