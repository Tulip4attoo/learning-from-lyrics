,Elvis Costello & Allen Toussaint, Six-Fingered Man,"Six-Fingered Man ,Playing a seven-string guitar ,There are Seven Deadly Sins ,Any one of them can do you in ,Take what you lost from what you win ,It's never enough ,Six-Fingered Man ,Always the first to blow his horn ,His achievements multiply ,Pity half of them seem to be lies ,Always helps to advertise ,It's never enough ,He seems so satisfied ,With a reputation to protect ,Unless he thinks that you're more qualified ,Gets so much of his own affection ,Stares for hours at his reflection ,Long-legged gal walking a very tiny man ,They say that it should be forbidden ,Must be something he has hidden ,Take what you want from what you're given ,Oh, it's never enough ,Six-Fingered Man ,Shaking his fist at everyone ,Couldn't even act his age ,If you put him on a stage ,You might say he's all the rage ,But it's never enough ,Getting his prints on everything ,He's got semi-precious gems ,Glinting in his signet ring ,Needs his fingers and his thumbs ,To help him calculate his sums ,Six-Fingered Man ,Can't be bothered to stir himself ,Sleeps the whole day long or more ,Dreams of someone he adores ,Drains one drink and starts to pour ,Oh, it's never enough ,Oh, it's never enough ,Oh, it's never enough ,Six-Fingered ,Man Alive! ,How'd I ever get along with five?

,Elefante, Ahora Que,"Ahora que me quema el frio,,Que no siento tus latidos,,Que el olvido me toco,,Donde guardo lo que siento,,Donde escondo este dolor,,Solo algunas huellas han quedado,,Sueños que tu ahusencia se llevo,Y voy bebiendome el olvido,Enborrachando el corazon,Para intentar sentirme vivo,Pa arrancarme este dolor,Y voy bebiendome el olvido,Engañando la razon,Para sentir que no te has hido,Pa que no duela esta cancion,Ahora que no estas conmigo,Que me encuentro tan perdido,Que el silencio me abrazo,,Donde guardo lo que siento,Donde pongo tus recuerdos,,Donde escondo este dolor,,Solo algunas huellas se han quedado,,Sueños que tu ausencia se llevo,Y voy bebiendome el olvido,Enborrachando el corazon,Para intentar sentirme vivo,Pa arrancarme este dolor,Y voy bebiendome el olvido,Engañando la razon,Para sentir que no te has hido,Pa que no duela esta cancion,Y voy bebiendome el olvido,Engañando la razon para sentir,Que no te has hido para,Que no duela esta cancion

,Elton John, Postcards from Richard Nixon,"We heard Richard Nixon say, ""Welcome to the USA"",The common sense I sometimes lack,Has opened up a seismic crack,We've fallen in and I can't pull back,In open arms we put our trust they put us on a big red bus,Twin spirits soaking up a dream,Fuel to feed the press machine,After years that were long and lean,And Richard Nixon's on his knees he's sent so many overseas,He'd like to know if you and me could help him in some way,A little camouflage and glue to mask the evil that men do,A small diversion caused by two,Pale kids come to play,And we heard Richard Nixon say, ,Neither of us understood the way things ticked in Hollywood,We just loaded in and grabbed the bat,With little room to swing a cat,And pretty soon we were where it's at,And all around us suntanned teens, beauty like we'd never seen,Our heroes led us by the hand,Through Brian Wilson's promised land,Where Disney's God and he commands,And Richard Nixon's on his knees he's sent so many overseas,He'd like to know if you and me could help him in some way,A little camouflage and glue to mask the evil that men do,A small diversion caused by two,Pale kids come to play,And we heard Richard Nixon say, ,In a bright red Porsche on Sunset I saw Steve McQueen,I guess he's just about the coolest guy I've ever seen,And for you and me that speeding car is how it's going to be,I see no brakes just open road and lots of gasoline,Oh we heard Richard Nixon say, ""Welcome to the USA"",The common sense I sometimes lack,Has opened up a seismic crack,We've fallen in and I can't pull back,Pale kids come to play,And we heard Richard Nixon say, ,

What would you do?,(Did you find out how to lie?),Children and animals two by two,(Did you find out how to cheat?),Give me the needle,(The elite bleat, they're obsolete),We're going to melt them down,Stick out your tongue,Now if you'd only genuflect,Stick out your tongue,Now if you'd only genuflect,Stick out your tongue

Stephens"",Daggers were drawn on pistols pulled,Staggering 'til dawn filled up with whiskey and rum,And several drunken players ran amok,Rampaging with the crew around the deck,And I received a blow that was unkind,It turned my cheek to the colour of gentian violet,I wouldn't say that this journey had quite been the highlight,Of the All-American Tour,Teetering on the edge of war,Out of the genteel Northern prosceniums,Filled up with imitation Europeans,Down along the river of rough damnations,By the blood-stained cotton and the slave plantations

You are beautiful."",She handed me mirror and I saw her instead,She handed me a mirror,She handed me a mirror,And that is all she did

,Mark Lane, The King of Silence,"The King of Silence has been crowned,You see his lips move,But he just don't make a sound,Amazed by the absurd,Nobody says a word,A voice of consolation is not heard,I see madness up ahead,A violent sea engulfs the path on which I've tread,Engrossed by the obscene,I'm drifting far between,The beacons of assurance seldom seen,If I could find a way,I would start today,Tracing back the trail from where it led,Find a way,I would start today,Conducting this strange music in my head,The Duke of Stillness stakes his place,He's been there waiting,Since his tragic fall from grace,Alarmed by what's concealed,His ignorance revealed,Afraid to open up the fate that's sealed,If I can find a way,I will start today,Tracing back the trail from whence I came,Find a way,I will start today,Reciting some strange dream I cannot name

,Martha Wainwright, Tower Song,"We had visions in the night,I was scared and you held me tight,It was like we were in black and white,As clear as day, as dark as night,And the truth became a lie,There was no longer peace of mind,Just fear of the unknown and the unkind,And then when he undressed me,And took my body,I was resolute to being fine,Now the soldiers are all on fire,And our hearts are dead from desire,And when you say it has nothing to do,Nothing to do with you, you're a liar,Now the sky is filled with dust,Of those we loved and those we lost,Rebuild the tower,Make it last longer,Make it stronger,Give up your power

,Elisabeth Andreassen,Väken I En Dröm,"När en ny dag växt till liv,Just när natten har fått ge vika,Och jag tänker på allting jag gjort,Från ett barn till den jag är nu,På min resa har jag känt,Inte alltid man var tillräcklig,Men jag har förstått nu efteråt,Att jag gjort allt så gott jag kan,Som i en dröm,Där himlens alla stjärnor,Flyr sin väg bort med natten,Min dröm där inget är förevigt,Men min själ har fått ro,Jag är tacksam för det här,All den glädje jag fått uppleva,Även sorger och ett tungt farväl,Det har gjort mig till den jag är,Känner vinden i mitt hår,Känner storhet i att få leva,Har den vishet om den väg jag går,Och en dag ska jag komma fram,Som i en dröm,Där himlens alla stjärnor,Flyr sin väg bort med natten,Min dröm där inget är förevigt,Men min själ har fått ro,Och en ny dag växt till liv,Just när natten har fått ge vika,Allting vaknar upp på nytt igen,Jag är vaken mitt i en dröm

,Elefante, La historia sin fin,"Me dices que no, que no volveras,Que ya nada importa que nada es igual,Que se te acabo, el vino y el pan,Y poquito a poco la ganas de amar,No se que paso, ni que pasara,A veces la vida nos trata tan mal,Yo aqui seguire, tu te marcharas,Dejando recuerdos, y el ultimo adios clavado en mi pecho,Fantasmas que muerden, cadenas que atan,Señales de una tempestad, sabor amargo soledad,Millones de sueños dormidos muriendo,El crudo invierno por llegar, la triste historia sin final,Y que puedo hacer, de que servira??,Ahogar esta pena quererte olvidar,Si vives en mi, si nunca te iras, te llevo tan dentro,No se lo que hare, ni se lo que haras,pero si regresas me vas a encontrar,Yo aqui seguire, tu te marcharas,Dejando recuerdos, y el ultimo adios clavado en mi pecho,Fantasmas que muerden, cadenas que atan,Señales de una tempestad, sabor amargo soledad,Millones de sueños dormidos muriendo,El crudo invierno por llegar, la triste historia sin final,Mi mundo , se ha quedado parado,Y esta vida la quiero caminar pero a tu lado,Fantasmas que muerden, cadenas que atan,Señales de una tempestad, sabor amargo soledad,Millones de sueños dormidos muriendo,El crudo invierno por llegar, la triste historia sin final

,The Band From Rockall, Into The Aurora,"The summer came early for you,As the first buds they flowered that year,She swore we'd be blood lovers,And she carved out that promise in years,Now there's no sad stories,No heartbreak years, no deceit,As dawn after oncoming dawn,Crossed the Blashaval fields,Out of the door of the church,Where first we stood walking as one,I heard the tongue of my people all around,As they stood tall in the sun,They gave us daughters,They gave us rivers and roads,All the streetlights of Greenock aglow,The Clyde following home,So tonight we wait here in the world,With what little faith we possess,I can't settle now for the years,The whole deal nothing less,Clouds drift over the roof,They're leaving the land,over the hills of Ahmore,And the Orinsay strand,So who could have told us all this,So come close and let's talk,Cause it's out of the ether,And into the aurora we walk,Let's go down to the deep well of love,Right to the end,Till we love again,Should we love again
