,Barry White, Under The Influence Of Love,"Under the Influence of Love,Walkin' on a cloud,Feeling high,It happens every time,Whenever I'm with my guy,Tripping on love,And it feels so good,I can't help myself,And I wouldn't think I could,Plus he's got that certain drive,That I'm a victim to,Love's really got a hold on me,And there's nothing that I'd rather do,Oh, I'm right Under The Influence Of Love,And, I know there ain't no doubt about it,I'm Under The Influence Of Love,And I know I just can't live without it,Need another dose,Can't get enough,I've just got to have,All of my baby's love,And, when I'm alone,Feeling sad and blue,He gives me a shot of love,And I'm as good as new,Helpless as I am,Ask me, I don't care,His tenderness is what I miss,Whenever he's not here,Oh, I'm Under The Influence Of Love,And, I know there ain't no doubt about it,I'm Under The Influence Of Love,And I know I just can't live without it,There just ain't no one else,Who can bring out the love in me,So many guys have tried,They've tried to catch my eye,But he's the only one I see,Oh, I'm Under The Influence Of Love,And, I know there ain't no doubt about it,I'm Under The Influence Of Love,And I know I just can't live without it,Oh, I'm Under The Influence Of Love,And, I know there ain't no doubt about it

,Elton John, Tinderbox,"Nostradamus said ""I predict,That the world will end at half past six"",What he didn't say was exactly when,Was he listening to the radio?,Was he listening to the government?,Well he got us spooked anyway,We'd been running hot up until today,But a wind of change blew across our sails,We were coasting on a winning streak,We were kings until the power failed,Godzilla came in disguise,Tore the building down right before our eyes,Kept the needle out of the red balloon,Was he worried we might go too far,Maybe wind up rhyming moon and June,The sun descends down in Mexico,While a fancy car back on Savile Row,Shows the price of fame leads to overkill,Things are gonna have to change,Some holes along the road get filled,Pressure's gonna cook us if we don't unlock it,Guns going off if we don't uncock it,We've gotta climb out of the other one's pocket,Or we're gonna burn, out on this beautiful rocket,

S'pose I'll be alright,'Specially when the sky is so blue,But if she's sad of eyes with deep blue sighs,Let me sing this song again just like it's new,Oooh! Well baby, here's my final letter,Hmmm!
